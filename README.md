"# platform45_frontend_Challenge" 

Challenges faced:

No prior framework had to be used, everything had to be started from scratch. It was an interesting challenge as I had to find out my own style of getting through the obstacles. I had thought of adding Bootstrap but remembered that no frameworks could be used.

I also had issues with the animation, was battling with that for a bit and that lead to me not having enough time to implement responsiveness and media queries unto the design.

Overall it was a good experience and I learnt quite a lot. If I had more time or infact full time attention to this challenge then it would have been done much sooner (probably).
